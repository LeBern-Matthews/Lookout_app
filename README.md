## Instructions
1. Ensure you have Python 3.8 or above installed.
2. Install required libraries using pip:
    
       pip install public_ip requests
    
3. Ensure the following files are in the repository:
   - `home.png`,`user.png`,`id-card.png`,and `test.png`: Icons for the navigation bar
   - `country_data.json`: A JSON file containing emergency contact information for various countries.
## Usage
1. Run the program by:
   1. Opening a terminal and typing
   
          python app_script.py
      
   2. double click on the file titled `app_script.py`
2. The app will detect your public IP and automatically determine your country using an IP geolocation service
   
3. Navigate through the app using the buttons in the navigation bar
    - Home Button: View your preparedness progress and weather updates
    - Checklist Button: Access and interact with the checklist of essential supplies
    - Contacts Button: View emergency contact information for your country
    - Profile Button: Reserved for future user-specific features.


## Functions

`main()`
- The main function that initializes and runs the application
- Sets up the window title, size, and icon
- Makes the window non-resizable and centers it on screen

`layout()`
- Creates the entire layout of the application
- Sets up four main frames: home, checklist, contacts, and settings
- Configures the navigation bar and theme settings

`getcountry(IP: str)`
- Takes a public IP address as input
- Returns location information including country name, latitude, and longitude
- Uses the apiip.net service for geolocation

`emergency_contacts(Country_name: str)`
- Retrieves emergency contact information for a specific country
- Returns a dictionary containing police, ambulance, and fire department numbers
- Sources data from country_data.json

`has_internet_connection()`
- Checks if the device has an active internet connection
- Returns True if connected, False otherwise
- Tests connection by attempting to reach Google's DNS (8.8.8.8)

`weather_status(location_info: dict)`
- Gets current weather information based on latitude and longitude
- Returns weather conditions, temperature, and description
- Uses OpenWeatherMap API for weather data

`getIP()`
- Gets the device's public IP address
- Returns the IP address as a string
- Uses the public_ip library

`weather_stuff()`

- Updates global variables for weather display
- Handles both online and offline scenarios using cached data

Additional Functions:

`get_essentials()`
- Returns a list of essential items for hurricane preparedness
- Reads from essetial_items.txt file

`country_options()`
- Returns a list of supported countries
